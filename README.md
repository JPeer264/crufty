> A CLI to find crufty folders

## Why?

Sometimes you just do a `git clone` and `npm install` on any projects to just try something. But those folders will never get removed, so you are wasting a lot of storage.

Also if you want to find git repositories with unstaged or uncommitted changes it will also take some time to check every repository.
